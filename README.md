3. Write the `yarn` command in the project folder.
4. Write the command `yarn run initFiles`, the necessary configuration files will be created in the folder with the project.

## Preparing the bot for launch
1. Log in or register your [Telegram account](https://my.telegram.org/).
2. Then click "API development tools" and fill in the details of your application (only the name of the application and a short name are required).
3. Finally, click "Create Application".
4. Insert the API ID and API HASH in the .env file, as well as the application phone number.
5. Don't forget to put your bot's token into `TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN`.
6. Finally, the final file should look something like this:

```
## Launching the bot
- Enter the command `yarn run start`
- During startup, the bot will ask you to enter your password and code to sign in to your Telegram account. This data will later be written to an .env file, so make sure this file is secure!
